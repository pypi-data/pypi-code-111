Rohrer and Robert Beverly and Olivier Fourmaux and Timur Friedman},\n  title = {Diamond-Miner: Comprehensive Discovery of the Internet{\\textquoteright}s Topology Diamonds },\n  booktitle = {17th {USENIX} Symposium on Networked Systems Design and Implementation ({NSDI} 20)},\n  year = {2020},\n  isbn = {978-1-939133-13-7},\n  address = {Santa Clara, CA},\n  pages = {479--493},\n  url = {https://www.usenix.org/conference/nsdi20/presentation/vermeulen},\n  publisher = {{USENIX} Association},\n  month = feb,\n}\n```\n\n## Authors\n\nDiamond-Miner is developed and maintained by the [Dioptra group](https://dioptra.io) at [Sorbonne Université](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr) in Paris, France.\nThe initial version has been written by [Kévin Vermeulen](https://github.com/kvermeul), with subsequents refactoring and improvements by [Maxime Mouchet](https://github.com/maxmouchet) and [Matthieu Gouel](https://github.com/matthieugouel).\n\n## License & Dependencies\n\nThis software is released under the [MIT license](/LICENSE), in accordance with the license of its dependencies.\n\nName                                             | License                                                      | Usage\n-------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|------\n[pych-client](https://github.com/dioptra-io/pych-client) | [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) | Querying the database\n[pygfc](https://github.com/maxmouchet/gfc)       | [MIT](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)                   | Generating random permutations\n[python-zstandard](https://github.com/indygreg/python-zstandard) | [3-clause BSD](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) | Compression\n\n[^1]: As of v0.1.0, diamond-miner can discover the multipath topology in less than a day when probing at 100k pps.\n[^2]: Vermeulen, Kevin, et al.
